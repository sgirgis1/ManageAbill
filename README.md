ManageAbill Android Application
--------------------------------
ManageAbill is a native mobile application for Android which allows a user to manage and track personal expenses by setting due dates and reminders.
ManageAbill also allows users to split a bill between several people and include a tip percentage which will be calculated into the individual split amount.
I used Java, SQLite, and XML in creation and maintenance of this application while implementing user feedback.
